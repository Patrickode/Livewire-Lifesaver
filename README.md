# Livewire Lifesaver
You're a loose plasma globe trying to keep the current in your machine flowing smoothly. Roll between gaps to get the electric current to its receiver!

Livewire Lifesaver was originally my first Ludum Dare attempt, submitted to Ludum Dare 46's compo. I've been working on it further since.
